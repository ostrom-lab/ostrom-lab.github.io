# Research

The overall goal of the Ostrom Lab is to identify factors that increase the risk of developing a brain tumor as well as those that affect prognosis after diagnosis. 

Specifically, our research focuses on: 
<ol> <li>using population-level cancer registry data for surveillance and risk factor discovery</li> 
<li>discovering sources of germline genetic risk for brain tumors, and </li>
<li> understanding the relationship between immune traits and brain tumor risk and survival.</li></ol>

We approach these questions through a research program of interrelated projects and application of novel analytic techniques, leveraging data from prospective epidemiological studies, genetic data, cancer registry data, insurance claims data, electronic health records data, and other related data sources. 

Here are some themes that we currently work on:

<h4>Population-based statistics for primary brain tumors</h4>

The Ostrom lab is the primary data analysis center for <a href="http://cbtrus.org">the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States</a>, a resources which provides data on newly diagnosed primary brain tumors for ~99.9% of the United States from 2000-2020. 

We produce an <a href="https://cbtrus.org/reports/">annual statistical report</a> published in **Neuro-Oncology**. 

In addition to this, we use the CBTRUS data and other related cancer registry datasets for scientific projects related to our other themes. Recently this includes development of a package for estimating complete prevalence of cancer from incomplete data: <a href="https://github.com/ostrom-lab/prevEst">prevEst</a>, as well as a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37260822/">recode of primary brain and CNS tumor histopathologies</a> for use by other researchers.


<h4>Identifying risk factors for primary brain tumors>/h4>
We are interest in identifying individual, genetic, and environmental factors that affect individual risk of deveoping a brain tumor. Recent projects in this area have included: 
<ul><li>The impact of genetic ancestry, and/or race/ethnicity on risk for brain tumors, particularly glioma and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/noajnl/vdad020">meningioma</a>.</li>
<li> The impact of socioeconomic factors on risk of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noad223">meningioma</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.3171/2023.6.jns23342">pituitary tumors</a>. </li></ul>


<h4>Epidemiology of brain metastasis</h4>
We are interest in identifying individual, genetic, and environmental factors that affect individual risk of deveoping a brain tumor. Recent projects in this area have included: 
<ul><li>The impact of genetic ancestry, and/or race/ethnicity on risk for brain tumors, particularly glioma and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/noajnl/vdad020">meningioma</a>.</li>
<li> The impact of socioeconomic factors on risk of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noad223">meningioma</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.3171/2023.6.jns23342">pituitary tumors</a>. </li></ul>
