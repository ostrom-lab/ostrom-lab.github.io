# Research

The overall goal of my research program is to identify genetic factors that increase the risk of developing a brain tumor as well as those that affect prognosis after diagnosis. My research focuses on: 1) using population-level cancer registry data for surveillance and risk factor discovery; 2) discovering sources of germline genetic risk for brain tumors and 3) understanding the relationship between immune traits and brain tumor risk and survival. We approach these questions through a research program of interrelated projects and application of novel analytic techniques.

Here are some themes that we currently work on:

**Population-based statistics for primary brain tumors** The Ostrom lab is the primary data analysis center for <a href="http://cbtrus.org">the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States</a>, a resources which provides data on newly diagnosed primary brain tumors for ~99.9% of the United States from 2000-2020. We produce an <a href="https://cbtrus.org/reports/">annual statistical report</a> published in **Neuro-Oncology**. In addition to this, we use the CBTRUS data and other related cancer registry datasets for scientific projects related to our other themes. Recently this includes development of a package for estimating complete prevalence of cancer from incomplete data: <a href="https://github.com/ostrom-lab/prevEst">prevEst</a>, as well as a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37260822/">recode of primary brain and CNS tumor histopathologies</a> for use by other researchers..
